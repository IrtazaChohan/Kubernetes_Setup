# Kubernetes_Setup
Shows how to setup Kubernetes with various command line interfaces.

Use the ordering of the files to configure the cluster and this shows a three tier system - one master and two worker nodes.

Have included the kube-flannel.yml file that can be used for setup as well.

Notes and information I have gathered whilst doing various LinuxAcademy Kubernetes courses (they also provide a sandbox environment which is great to take so recommend you check them out).
